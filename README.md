# Final Decision
Doing this alone and comparing it to the group I was supposed to be in, Squirrel Hill South is still the most outdoors-y neighborhood there due to there being an absurd amount of trees and having the highest walkability score. This neighborhood does not have the most playing fields, but it is very close to the top with only having two less than the other two neighborhoods.

The playing fields dataset lists each field's name, what type of field it is, the distance of the outfield walls at left, center, and right field, and what neighborhood the field is in.
